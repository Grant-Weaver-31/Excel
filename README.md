Excel Cleaning Project
Here you can find the explanations of the data cleaning processes. If you wish to follow along, you can download the file (Raw_Data.csv).  

1) The file is csv format, thus the first thing that I did was to convert the file into a XLSX file. 
2) Make the column widths wide enough to view the columns.
3) Used the filter feature to find and delete all empty rows. 
4) Next, I removed all the duplicate rows. 
5) Then, I checked the data for spelling errors and corrected them. 
6) Next, I removed all double-spaces from the data. 
7) The department names were incorrectly imported into two columns, thus I used flash fill to put the name into only one column.
