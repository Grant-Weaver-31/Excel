# Bike Sales Dashboard

**Summary**: As with any data set, I cleaned the data to make the data workable. Next, I created some pivot tables to be able to visualize the data. Finally, I created a dashboard to put all the vizulations together. Takeaways that we see: married indivudals, males, higher salaries and people with shorter commute times are all more likely to have made a bike purchase. It should be noted that this is a walkthrough project with Alex the Analyst.

# Detailed Walkthrough
1) I removed all the duplicates in the data (26 in total).
2) Changed the input in a few of the columns to have more telling names. M-Married and S-Single for example. 
3) Created three brackets for the age: young adult, middle age and senior. 
4) Created a pivot table for bike purchase by income and gender. 
5) Created a pivot table by number of bikes purchased by commuting distance. 
6) Created a pivot table for bike purchases by age brackets. 
7) Next, I then created a dashboard including the three pivot tables. Then, formatting to make the dashboard easy to read.
8) Finally, added a few slicers so the person reading the dashboard can play around with it.
